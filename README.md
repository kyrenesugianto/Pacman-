# Pacman-Search

In this project, I delved into the implementation and testing of various search algorithms tailored for Pacman scenarios. 
Starting with my work on depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS), I crafted generic search functions capable of navigating through different maze configurations. 
By varying the cost function, I implemented the uniform-cost search algorithm and observed its behavior in different environments. 
The project also involved my implementation of the A* search algorithm, where I utilized heuristics to enhance efficiency. 
Addressing a more complex problem, I formulated the CornersProblem, requiring me to guide Pacman through all four corners of the maze. 
Subsequently, I designed a non-trivial, consistent heuristic for this problem. Transitioning to the challenge of optimizing Pacman's path to consume all dots, I implemented a heuristic for the FoodSearchProblem. 
Lastly, I tackled the task of suboptimal search, implementing the ClosestDotSearchAgent to efficiently find and consume the closest dot. 
Overall, this project provided a personal and comprehensive exploration of search algorithms and heuristics, showcasing my ability to address diverse Pacman navigation challenges.
